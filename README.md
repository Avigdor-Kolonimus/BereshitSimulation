# Beresheet lunar lander

This simulation was built by inspiration of SpaceIL project - Beresheet. Which is mission to land on the moon, more details can be found -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceIL

Beresheet spacecraft unfortunately didn't manage to land properly on the moon, there are many speculations and thoughts about the real reason of this failure, alot of reasons can be found on the interenet or SpaceIL site.

The main goal of this simulator is trying to make landing process successfully which will do it fully automatically using all sensors available in the craft.

We have here few parameters we count on: 
- Vertical Speed, Horizontal Speed, Distance, Angle-rotation, Altitude, Acceleration Rate, Weight, Fuel.

All these parameters and few more will calculate every frame; it can be either 1 per second or even more iterations per second.

There is no graphics in this simulation, so the only way to see what happened is debug mode on which prints details every frame.
